# Grid
1. Create a new project in Eclipse. 
2. Create a new package in your project called "edu.kzoo". 
3. Add the jar file grid.jar (in the zip file) to your project build path as follows: Right click (or control-click on a mac) on your project name. Choose "Build Path" and then "Configure Build Path" from the menus. A new window will come up, and you should be in the Libraries tab. Click on the button "Add External JARs..." Find the grid.jar file and click ok. 
4. Drag the three .java files in the JavaSourceFiles folder in the zip file onto the package edu.kzoo in Eclipse, and add "package edu.kzoo;" to the top of each of them. 
5. You should then be able to run GridPlotterApp.
